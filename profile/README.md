# Welcome to the GitHub organization of INFO! 

We are [INFO](https://info.nl/en/), your digital partner who helps translate your business challenges into digital products with impact, since 1994.

## General information

In our GitHub organization you can find our open source repositories and, if you are an INFO colleague and logged in to GitHub also our private repositories.

Please also check out our [INFO Technology Radar](https://infonl.github.io/info-techradar/index.html) where we keep track of our preferences regarding technology.

## Contributing

Please reach out to us should you want to contribute to any of our open source projects or just have questions or remarks.

## Fun facts

We generally prefer to use GitHub as source control management system (and more than that). In the past we have used (and for some we still do): Rational ClearCase, Visual SourceSafe, Subversion, Gitolite, Bitbucket Server and Bitbucket Cloud, Azure DevOps, AWS CodeCommit, GitLab. We have been around for a while. ;-)
